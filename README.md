# FriendFinder

## I created this project with 

* javascript 
* node 
* html 
* heroku 
* jquery.

It search through an array to let you know who are you most compatible with. I still have a lot of things to improve but I am really happy with the result.
To start just click the blue button to go to the survey page and then submit your answers. Through some logic the program will calculate who is your best match and
let you know with a boostrap modal.

To try the app you can go to this link: [FriendFinder](https://obscure-basin-56131.herokuapp.com/)

If you have any questions at all of the project you can email me at: almaguero95@gmail.com 

I'll happily answer anything you want to know.
